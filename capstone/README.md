## Project: Distracted Driver Detection

### Dependency

The main Python packages:
- [Opencv](http://opencv.org/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org)
- [Keras](https://keras.io)

The running environment is [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install.html).

### Data

The dataset is provided by [Kaggle State Farm](https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection/submissions?sortBy=date&group=successful&page=1). You can down load the dataset after creating an ancount.

The directory should be name as "capserver". Under this directory, there should be three folders: "data", "cache", "subm". 

The "data" folder is used for the dataset. The cache is created for the storage of the weights and data. And the submission file ".csv" will be created in the subm folder.

### Run

In the command line, make sure the you are in the "capserver" folder, then run the command as below:

```bash
jupyter notebook final.ipynb
```

It will start the jupyter notebook and open the project file in your browser
