## Proposal
Distracted Driver Detection.


### Domain Background
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, provide brief details on the background information of the domain from which the project is proposed. Historical information relevant to the project should be included. It should be clear how or why a problem in the domain can or should be solved. Related academic research should be appropriately cited in this section, including why that research is relevant. Additionally, a discussion of your personal motivation for investigating a particular problem in the domain is encouraged but not required.

We've all been there: a light turns green and the car in front of you doesn't budge. Or, a previously unremarkable vehicle suddenly slows and starts swerving from side-to-side.

When you pass the offending driver, what do you expect to see? You certainly aren't surprised when you spot a driver who is texting, seemingly enraptured by social media, or in a lively hand-held conversation on their phone.

According to the CDC motor vehicle safety division, one in five car accidents is caused by a distracted driver. Sadly, this translates to 425,000 people injured and 3,000 people killed by distracted driving every year.

State Farm hopes to improve these alarming statistics, and better insure their customers, by testing whether dashboard cameras can automatically detect drivers engaging in distracted behaviors. Given a dataset of 2D dashboard camera images, State Farm is challenging Kagglers to classify each driver's behavior.


### Problem Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe the problem that is to be solved. The problem described should be well defined and should have at least one relevant potential solution. Additionally, describe the problem thoroughly such that it is clear that the problem is quantifiable (the problem can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the problem can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the problem can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

We are given driver images, each taken in a car with a driver doing something in the car(texting, eating, talking on the phone, makeup, reaching behind, etc). Our goal is to predict the likelihood of what the driver is doing in each picture.

The 10 classes to predict are:
* c0: safe driving
* c1: texting - right
* c2: talking on the phone - right
* c3: texting - left
* c4: talking on the phone - left
* c5: operating the radio
* c6: drinking
* c7: reaching behind
* c8: hair and makeup
* c9: talking to passenger




### Datasets and Inputs
_(approx. 2-3 paragraphs)_

In this section, the dataset(s) and/or input(s) being considered for the project should be thoroughly described, such as how they relate to the problem and why they should be used. Information such as how the dataset or input is (was) obtained, and the characteristics of the dataset or input, should be included with relevant references and citations as necessary It should be clear how the dataset(s) or input(s) will be used in the project and whether their use is appropriate given the context of the problem.

### Solution Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### Benchmark Model
_(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail.

### Evaluation Metrics
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).

### Project Design
_(approx. 1 page)_

In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.
